#**fineBook**

V1.00 by http://qland.de
finer bookmarks

expands *firefox* bookmark ability by page position and selection

- save and restore reading positions and small selections in web pages
- especially useful for following forum threads
- also usable as software version tracker

if a regular bookmark is created a title and url are stored,
invoking it fetches a page corresponding the saved url,
thereby the page is always displayed from top

imagine following a thread with some ten posts a day,
so if you resume reading after some days the thread will
have lots of new posts and pages and it might be difficult
to find the position you stopped reading at your last session

*fineBook* allows to restore your reading position and makes it
easy to follow up reading with some additional clicks only

**version 1.00**
- reworked ui and logic
- completely context menu driven
- using current *jpm* framework
